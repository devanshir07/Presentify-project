# WebViewer Files

This directory should contain the PDFTron WebViewer files necessary for viewing and editing presentations.

After installing the @pdftron/webviewer package, please ensure that the files from the `node_modules/@pdftron/webviewer/public` directory are copied to this location.

You can copy them manually or use the `copy-webviewer.js` script included in the project.
